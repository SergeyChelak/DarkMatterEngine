# Dark Matter

**Dark Matter** is a nascent game engine under development, targeting **Apple platforms** with an initial focus on **macOS**. The engine is being built using **Swift** and leverages the **Metal** graphics library for rendering, with shaders written in **Metal Shading Language (MSL)**. Its architecture is based on an **Entity-Component-System (ECS)** design, drawing inspiration from the principles of the Bevy engine, but implemented as an independent project and not a port.
